# Error Log: `is_movie_review` Classification Testing

**Date:** July 5, 2025

**Objective:** To test the `is_film_review` classification function located in `crawl/llm/openai_wrapper.py` by running a dedicated test script (`test_classification.py`). The goal was to isolate and verify the classification logic before investigating database update issues.

**Problem Encountered:** Persistent `ModuleNotFoundError` exceptions during the execution of `test_classification.py`, preventing the script from running successfully.

**Troubleshooting Steps and Outcomes:**

1.  **Initial Attempt (Missing `dotenv`):**
    *   **Error:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dotenv'`
    *   **Action:** Attempted to install `python-dotenv` using `pip install python-dotenv`.
    *   **Outcome:** `bash: pip: command not found`. This indicated that the system's `pip` was not in the PATH, or the virtual environment's `pip` was not being used correctly.

2.  **Second Attempt (Virtual Environment `pip` issue):**
    *   **Error:** `bash: /Users/ravi/Documents/GitHub/movie-review-miner/.venv/bin/pip: /Users/ravi/Documents/GitHub/movie-review-miner/backend/.venv/bin/python3.13: bad interpreter: No such file or directory`
    *   **Action:** Tried to use the virtual environment's `pip` directly: `/Users/ravi/Documents/GitHub/movie-review-miner/.venv/bin/pip install python-dotenv`.
    *   **Outcome:** The virtual environment's `pip` executable itself had an incorrect interpreter path.

3.  **Third Attempt (Using `python -m pip`):**
    *   **Error:** (No error, `python-dotenv` was already satisfied)
    *   **Action:** Used the virtual environment's Python interpreter to run `pip`: `/Users/ravi/Documents/GitHub/movie-review-miner/.venv/bin/python3 -m pip install python-dotenv`.
    *   **Outcome:** `Requirement already satisfied: python-dotenv`. This confirmed `python-dotenv` was installed, and the previous errors were related to `pip`'s execution, not the package's presence.

4.  **Fourth Attempt (Incorrect `sys.path.append` in `test_classification.py`):**
    *   **Error:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'utils'` (originating from `crawl/llm/openai_wrapper.py` trying to import `utils.logger`).
    *   **Action:** Modified `test_classification.py` to append the project root to `sys.path` (`sys.path.append(os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..')))`).
    *   **Outcome:** The error persisted. The issue was not with `sys.path` in the test script, but with how relative imports within the `crawl` package were being resolved when `crawl` itself was not treated as a package.

5.  **Fifth Attempt (Setting `PYTHONPATH`):**
    *   **Error:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'utils'` (still from `crawl/llm/openai_wrapper.py`).
    *   **Action:** Ran the test script with `PYTHONPATH=/Users/ravi/Documents/GitHub/movie-review-miner` to explicitly tell Python where to find the `crawl` package.
    *   **Outcome:** The error persisted because `openai_wrapper.py` was using an absolute import (`from utils.logger import get_logger`) instead of a relative one, even though `crawl` was now on the `PYTHONPATH`.

6.  **Sixth Attempt (Correcting relative import in `openai_wrapper.py`):**
    *   **Error:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'db'` (now from `crawl/utils/step_logger.py` trying to import `db.pipeline_logger`).
    *   **Action:** Modified `crawl/llm/openai_wrapper.py` to use a relative import: `from ..utils.logger import get_logger`.
    *   **Outcome:** This fixed the import in `openai_wrapper.py`, but exposed another similar issue in `crawl/utils/step_logger.py`.

7.  **Seventh Attempt (Correcting relative import in `step_logger.py`):**
    *   **Error:** User cancelled the `replace` tool call.
    *   **Action:** Attempted to modify `crawl/utils/step_logger.py` to use a relative import: `from ..db.pipeline_logger import log_step_result`.
    *   **Outcome:** The user cancelled the operation, halting the troubleshooting process for the import errors.

**Summary of Unresolved Issues:**
The primary blocker is a chain of `ModuleNotFoundError` exceptions due to incorrect absolute imports within the `crawl` package's internal modules (`openai_wrapper.py`, `step_logger.py`). These need to be converted to relative imports to ensure proper module resolution when the `crawl` directory is treated as a Python package. The last attempt to fix this was cancelled by the user.
