# Feature Development

Structured workflow for implementing a new feature step-by-step.

## Instructions

1. **Clarify Requirements**
   - Ask what exactly the user wants to build
   - Identify acceptance criteria
   - Understand constraints and edge cases

2. **Research & Plan**
   - Explore relevant existing code
   - Identify files that need to change
   - Consider architectural implications
   - Write a detailed implementation plan

3. **Create Todo List**
   - Break down into small, testable steps
   - Order by dependencies
   - Estimate complexity (simple/medium/complex)

4. **Implement**
   - Work through todos one at a time
   - Test each step before moving on
   - Update todos as you progress

5. **Verify**
   - Run relevant tests or dry-run
   - Check for regressions
   - Review changes before committing
