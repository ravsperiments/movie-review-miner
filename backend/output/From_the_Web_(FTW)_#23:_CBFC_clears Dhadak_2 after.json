  "full_review": "Dharma Productions has been fighting with the CBFC for a long time over this PARIYERUM PERUMAL remake, with Siddhant Chaturvedi and Triptii Dimri.\n\nThis Hindu article tells a lot of about what offended the Censors.\n\nSample: \u201cOne of the cuts says that the \u201cBlue colour of the dog was removed\u201d. The original film features a mystical sequence where a brutally killed dog\u2019s blue-coloured spirit rescues the protagonist. In another scene, sixteen seconds of a three minute scene featuring the \u201chumiliation of Nilesh\u2019s father\u201d was cut. A line saying, \u201cDharam ka kaam hai,\u201d (\u201cthis is religious work\u201d), was replaced with \u201cPunya ka kaam hai\u201d (\u201cthis is [work toward] a good deed\u201d).\u00a0\u201c\n\nMy point is:\n\nWhen another Censor Board (from Tamil Nadu) has already allowed the \u201cblue dog scene\u201d or the urination scene, can a new Censor Body object to these? Especially when the original is already available on video?\n\nIt\u2019s confusing."
