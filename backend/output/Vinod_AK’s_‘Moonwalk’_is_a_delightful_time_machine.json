  "full_review": "The story is about a group of youngsters from very humble backgrounds who want to set the stage on fire in the Michael Jackson era. As always in Malayalam cinema, the way this simple story is told is fantastic. The rest of this review may contain spoilers.\n\nIn an early scene inMoonwalk, a young woman tells a young man to watch out for her Bharatanatyam performance at the college culturals. The scene could be set anywhere. It unfolds in a chemistry lab. This flavour of \u201clife happens\u201d \u2013 only Malayalam cinema captures it in a way that shows how life really happens. Things are not always dramatic. Sometimes, it\u2019s just something that\u2019s conveyed in a chemistry lab. Some other times, it may be something conveyed in a moving bus, whose insides are lit in green. This time, it\u2019s an argument between three college boys, and when this argument begins, the camera stays on these three college boys. But a minute later, we cut to a wide shot and we see the others in the bus, who have nothing to do with these boys and their argument. A man in front lets out a yawn. To the boys, their argument is everything. To the rest of the world \u2013 at least, the rest of this bus \u2013 life just goes on. The most important thing for the man who is yawning is probably to get home and get into bed.\n\nYou can read the rest of the review here:\n\nCopyright \u00a92025 GALATTA."
