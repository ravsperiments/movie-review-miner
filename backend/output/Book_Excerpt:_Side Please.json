  "full_review": "Madan Mohan\n\nSide Please \u2013 Eight Days of Mumbai Madness is a novel about what life in Maximum City is like, captured through a look at eight days in the life of our protagonist.\u00a0 The expression Side Please is itself a very authentically Mumbai one.\u00a0 The slim length of the book is intended to capture the frenetic pace and intensity of life in the city and the generous helpings of humour (captured in the artwork) reflect the city\u2019s can-do spirit which, more than anything, helps the citizenry stay sane in the face of daily obstacles en route to getting to their workplace (or on the way back).\n\nIt is available on Amazon India at the below link:\n\nOn Amazon.com below:\n\nFor the esteemed audience of this blog, I am sharing an excerpt that is more nostalgic/poignant and which is maybe the biggest slab of pure prose (as opposed to conversations/interactions) in the book.\n\nEXCERPT\n\nAh, he had an idea.\u00a0 If he left right away, he could get there before sunset.\u00a0 There was time.\u00a0 It was a clear day too. And he hoped it would flush out the negativity around the failed home deal from his system.\n\nAnd so, as he hopped onto the elevator, he put in a request on the aggregators for a cab ride to Marine Drive.\u00a0 He gave NCPA as the landmark\u2026you couldn\u2019t very well say \u2018Marine Drive\u2019 on Ola!\n\nBy some good fortune, a cab was available and just a minute away.\u00a0 In fact, as he got out of the office block, a spanking new Dzire Tour lay in wait for him.\u00a0 He hopped on merrily.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t much traffic, being that he was heading down South precisely when people would be beginning the long and painful trek up North to get home.\n\nIn ten minutes, they were ascending the Bandra Worli Sealink.\u00a0 The driver excitedly informed him that once the Coastal Road was inaugurated, he would be able to speed across from Bandra to Princess Street Flyover.\n\nTrue, thought Shailesh, but he wondered too.\u00a0 He remembered when there had been no flyover over Maheshwari Udyan (or King\u2019s Circle as the old timers called it).\u00a0 He knew there hadn\u2019t been over the head of Khodadad Circle either.\u00a0 If you went far back enough in time, there used to be a roundabout at Heera Panna junction too.\u00a0 The view along the Haji Ali seaface had already changed beyond recognition and the Coastal Road was yet to be inaugurated.\n\nThis was supposed to the linear march of progress but were they all simply going round and round the island with ever increasing intensity but with no destination in sight?\n\nLost as he was in his thoughts, he didn\u2019t realize that he was just ten minutes away from Marine Drive.\n\n(\u2026)\n\nHe got down and started walking along to NCPA.\n\nIt was always a beautiful day when it was evening at Marine Drive.\u00a0 He would never stop loving every moment he spent there.\u00a0 He couldn\u2019t explain it.\u00a0 It was a feeling he knew many other Mumbaiites shared and most likely, they too wouldn\u2019t be able to explain it.\u00a0 It was the place itself, yes, but also the memories it held for so many of the city\u2019s denizens.\n\nHe had been here on at least four separate occasions with his college friends.\u00a0 Sumedh, Vineet, Pradeep and Ashutosh.\u00a0 They were not only collegemates but classmates.\u00a0 They had all had other friends too in college but somehow, this band of five had stuck together tighter and cohered into a clique.\n\n(\u2026)\n\nGolly, it had been a long time since they had met.\u00a0 The last time had been just before the pandemic and that one had happened a year after the previous.\u00a0 They had vowed to keep in touch after getting out of college but it was a promise that had become harder and harder to keep.\u00a0 They did keep in touch, still, in a manner of speaking \u2013 on a whatsapp group called \u2018College Masti\u2019.\n\nHe also had a very specific and vivid memory associated with Marine Drive and NCPA.\u00a0 Quite a few years back, he, who didn\u2019t know the first thing about Western classical music, had gone on a lark to attend a performance of Beethoven\u2019s Ninth Symphony at the NCPA and enjoyed it so much that he had walked out onto Marine Drive and taken in the breeze for a few minutes.\n\nHe looked to his left and there he was, right across the road from NCPA.\u00a0 He hadn\u2019t even noticed! Maybe it was because there was hardly any breeze.\u00a0 Here he was, standing right by the sea, with only the promenade wall and the tetrapods in the way.\u00a0 And yet, Marine Drive, even at nearly 6 PM felt just as hot as anywhere else in the city.\n\nHe looked wistfully out to the horizon and then, he saw what he had come all the way for.\u00a0 The sight of the sun gently setting.\u00a0 A sight that brought forth another visual from the memory bank.\n\nHe had come here more times than he could remember back in his articleship days when visiting the offices of an audit client in Nariman Point.\n\nThere had been days when he had come to their office from his firm\u2019s office in Dadar and taken the train to Churchgate to do so.\u00a0 Knowing that he needed to get there ASAP, he had still eschewed the long queues for bus or shared taxi rides to Nariman Point from Churchgate or even the shortcut via Eros.\u00a0 He had instead gone past Ambassador Hotel and turned left to walk on to Nariman Point\u2026via Marine Drive.\n\nThere had been days during the audit when he had not been in the best of moods.\u00a0 And he had wandered down to Marine Drive on the pretext of fetching something to eat from the sandwich stalls in Nariman Point.\u00a0 Sitting there silently for ten to fifteen minutes, staring at the sea, at the horizon of blue nothingness, had made him at least momentarily forget whatever had got him down.\n\nBut he had never been able to see the sun setting on the Arabian Sea at Marine Drive.\u00a0 And he would today.\n\nHe watched silently for the next fifteen minutes as the sun approached closer and closer to the frontier of the sea on the horizon.\u00a0 The sight of the sun seemingly melting away into the water, illusory as it was, could only be savoured here at Marine Drive.\n\nWhich is why so many people gathered here.\u00a0 And the place was getting crowded now.\n\nIt was time to move on.\u00a0 Time seemed to stand still at Marine Drive.\u00a0 Or at\u2026.\n\nYes, he thought.\u00a0 He would go there too.\n\nHe hailed another cab for a ride to the other end of the Southern tip of the city.\n\nTwenty minutes later, he got down at Apollo Bunder and beheld the majestic monument that is the Gateway of India.\n\nIn a city where almost every landmark of note had been renamed, nobody had bothered with the idea of renaming Gateway of India.\u00a0 It was in some ways unaccountable, this strange love Mumbaiites had for the city\u2019s British legacy.\u00a0 The fact that they had left behind these lovely buildings as well as laid the foundations for the railway network that had become the city\u2019s lifeline surely didn\u2019t excuse all the looting they had gleefully carried out.\u00a0 And yet, nothing matched the affection he, like so many other of his fellow Mumbaiites, had for the city\u2019s British era relics.\n\nPerhaps, like Marine Drive, the timelessness of Gateway served as an anchor.\u00a0 As something to hold onto for those who had spent a long time, maybe too long of a time, in the city.\u00a0 As everything around you changed, you could still stand right next to Gateway and turn the pages of the photo album in your mind as the memories came flooding back.\n\nHe remembered the time he had gone along with his grandfather on a trip around South Mumbai. The trip had encompassed every corner of South Mumbai, from Nariman Point to Cuffe Parade to Gateway and everything en route.\u00a0 It was his grandfather who had told him that the specific style of architecture seen on the buildings along Marine Drive was called Art Deco. While the CSMT building was apparently in Italian Gothic style.\n\nIt had only been a couple of years since grandfather had passed away.\u00a0 The memories came flooding back indeed and so did the tears.\n\nAs he stood there silently, tears streaming down his eyes, the phone rang.\n\nMother asked, \u201cHave you started, dear?\u201d\n\nHe shook his head and said, \u201cI am at Gateway.\u201d\n\nShe was astonished. \u201cWhat are you doing there?\u00a0 Did you have some meeting with bankers?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I just\u2026never mind.\u00a0 I am starting back for home now.\u201d"
