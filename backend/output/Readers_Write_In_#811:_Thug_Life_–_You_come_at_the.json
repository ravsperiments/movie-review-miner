  "full_review": "By Sai Ganga\n\nAs the dust settles as Thug Life has finally hit us, the reactions summarize how Mani Ratnam\u2019s career has been \u2013 like him or hate him, you just can\u2019t ignore him. The fact that his films still elicit a reaction from audiences four decades after Pallavi Anupallavi released is a testament to his longevity. The difference this time around has been the extreme reactions owing\u00a0mostly\u00a0to the presence of Vinveli Nayagan himself;\u00a0(got to say, I\u00a0was taken aback with BR saying it would be best if both of them don\u2019t work together). But\u00a0a\u00a0lot to unpack on the move itself\u2026\n\nThe conceit is solid- a Mani Ratnam heroTMwho is thrown into a new world but for whom death comes calling and each time it takes away the person he loves the most, his skirmishes with\u00a0the law\u00a0engagement, his inter personal struggles\u00a0giving us an intimate\u00a0and\u00a0macro view\u00a0at the same time. But what worked in a Nayagan, Thalapathi, Guru and to a big extent in Raavanan and not in TL is the somewhat distant nature of the proceedings and a lack of emotional core. We don\u2019t feel why Amaran would straight off buy into Chinnavar killing his father, we don\u2019t feel Naazar\u2019s jealousy, we don\u2019t feel what the other capos have against Chinnavar to turn against him; a woman committing suicide because of pregnancy in an MR movie- really ? The result being the characters don\u2019t strike an emotional chord with us. Even Amaran\u2019s death doesn\u2019t engage much save for Chandra\u2019s appearance and Aishwarya Lekshmi has to do the heavy lifting here (Chinnavar keeps checking Amaran\u2019s watch here. Wonder why).\n\nBut at the same time, the magic and the\u00a0genius\u00a0bits are there in the movie- a brother and sister separated at childhood; one raised by\u00a0a\u00a0gangster and the other by\u00a0a\u00a0cop (kodukku inthapakkam & anthapakkam),\u00a0the entire staging of Trisha\u2019s entry\u00a0scene- one would have seen pretty much every expression of KH over the years, but this scene brilliantly brings in a mischief and playfulness\u00a0in his face; completely new, the Chinnavar and Amaran scene where he doesn\u2019t\u00a0really\u00a0apologize for him doubting \u00a0Amaran\u00a0but explains context and his mindset- it is Delhi and the history of fratricide the place has seen;\u00a0the action pieces especially the car shoot out scene\n\nHowever, I think the reason why the movie hasn\u2019t worked with the audience is MR himself \u2013\u00a0After watching TL,\u00a0I really\u00a0believe him\u00a0when he says he\u2019s not here to play it to the gallery and to make what the audience \u201cwants\u201d. I mean, to put a \u201cnon massy\u201d Maara song for Simbu\u2019s entry scene, not showing any chest thumping training bit for Kamal\u2019s comeback to set the stage,\u00a0Chinnavar\u2019s equation outside the wedlock (Chinnavar telling\u00a0Jeeva to think of\u00a0his infidelity\u00a0as BP was hard to digest;\u00a0glad that MR didn\u2019t make\u00a0Ganapathy Uncle from Ok Kanmani mouth that dialogue);\u00a0even the final show off with Simbu and Kamal are treated as part of the narrative.\n\nMy hypothesis is all this would have worked uptill the early 2000\u2019s but the commercial film language (especially the gangster movies\u00a0post Lokesh\u2019s entry) and the theatre going crowd have gone through a massive upheaval. The millennials and Gen Z who throng the theatres in the first weekend want the elevation scenes, a wink to the previous movies\u00a0(no the little boy in the oversized shirt doesn\u2019t count), a racy BGM (probably we might have to call it with a heavy heart\u2013 Anirudh trumps ARR in action genre scoring ) some decent rug pulling (yes Agent Tina kinda \u00a0thing). That\u2019s the reason why the movie got such a thrashing\u00a0on\u00a0the first day.\n\nBut the mature audience seem to not hate it and like it for what it is. Unfortunately of late,\u00a0everything is either cringe or sambhavam. Nothing exists in between.\n\nUnfortunately,\u00a0Thug Life falls into the list of Star Director & A list hero underperformers- Dunki, Retro, Jab Harry Met Sejal, Malaikottai Vaaliban, Vettayan etc and we wonder why we cant have our Killers of the Flower Moon, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, The Irish Man,\u00a0The\u00a0Revenant\u00a0etc). Well, for now the juggernaut moves to Coolie.."
