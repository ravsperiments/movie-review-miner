  "full_review": "By Vijaysree V\n\nCrying over PasaMalar\n\nThe proprietor of Rani Cable Networks (Kamalahasan) is luxuriating in the last scenes of a black-and-white Tamil melodrama. (kai veesuamma kai veesu). His young assistant, who saunters in just then, cannot resist taking a dig at the boss who has gone all misty-eyed over a movie. The boss dabs his eyes with the edge of his veshti and comes back with: \u201cEven the toothbrush-mustached Hitler wept, watching films.\u201d And besides, the boss demands to know, if someone watchesPasaMalarand doesn\u2019t cry, should that person even be considered human?\n\nWithout missing a beat, the assistant asks if Hitler had watchedPasaMalarand follows up with another jab, \u201cbut you don\u2019t even need the excuse of a film. Seeing \u2018Starring Sivaji Ganesan\u2019 in the title credits is enough to set you off.\u201d\u00a0 Jeymohan, the dialogue writer forPapanasam, likely intended to highlight the fact that the boss was a Sivaji fan. Yet, he must have also recognized how deeply this would resonate with audiences\u2014because it\u2019s easy to imagine the real Kamal Haasan being moved to tears by a Sivaji Ganesan classic. His connection to the legendary actor and the profound impact Sivaji had on Tamil cinema make the moment feel so authentic.\n\nThe 1961 filmPasaMalardirected by Bhimsingh is an unapologetic tear-jerker, a whole box-of-tissues weepie with a brother-sister relationship at its core. The siblings are Raju (Sivaji Ganesan) and Radha (Savithri) who were orphaned young, and they have always meant the world to each other ever since. They manage to lift themselves out of poverty. The brother, once a factory worker, becomes a factory owner. He learns to speak English, takes piano lessons, and even wears tuxedos on occasion.\u00a0 The bubbly sister, all nicely turned out, learns to drive. When people see her take the wheel of the Plymouth car, they ask, \u201cwhich principality is she a princess of!\u201d Her brother, determined to secure the best future for her, wants her to marry an eligible bachelor\u2014someone befitting their new status.\n\nWhile Raju and Radha rise from poverty together,PasaMalarintroduces another pair of orphaned siblings\u2014architect Bhaskar (M. N. Nambiar) and his sister, Dr. Malathi (M. N. Rajam) who come from wealth. A well-wisher introduces the two brothers to each other, so each can marry the other\u2019s sister. Raju is all for the architect marrying his sister. When it comes to the other proposal \u2014 his marrying the physician \u2014 he demurs. How can an uneducated person like me marry an educated woman, the factory owner asks. For the physician, however, it is love at first sight. At a party, when she hands Raju some sherbet in a nice glass, he politely says, \u201cthank you.\u201d His diction is better than that of our professor\u2019s, a friend observes, and urges her not to miss this chance. Raju accompanies Dr. Malathi on the piano. (pattu ondru ketten, paravasam annen).\n\nThe stage seems set for a nice double wedding, when Raju discovers that his sister is in love with his friend, a fellow worker from his old factory days. Now, this won\u2019t do at all, will it? Sivaji gives the lover boy Anand (Gemini Ganesan) a proper thrashing. When Anand asks Radha to elope with him, she says she will only marry him with her brother\u2019s blessings. \u201cHe will have to fall at my feet first,\u201d Anand enraged. Radha will not stand for any disrespect to her brother. She is ready to call the whole thing off. The brother, who is secretly watching all this, wipes the tear trickling down his cheek, with the barrel of his loaded pistol. Secure in his sister\u2019s undying loyalty and affection, he throws the firearm away. He has decided to bless Radha and Anand\u2019s marriage. This poignant scene unfolds in a rose garden.\n\nDr. Malathi marries Raju. A rare female physician character in Tamil cinema, she is depicted as an independent woman\u2014driving herself to work, deeply engaged in her profession. In one scene, she tells Raju she cannot attend a social engagement with him because she has a physicians\u2019 meeting at Town Hall at 5 PM. \u201cI am so sorry,\u201d she says firmly and politely when asked to reconsider. Raju immediately decides he won\u2019t attend the event either. Calling his friend, he lies, claiming his wife is unwell\u2014even though she is about to speak at a public forum. It is an absurd deception. Though Malathi stands firm in that moment, later, she falters, regretting her choice of professional ambition over family duty.\n\nMemorable songs were another defining feature of films from that era, andPasaMalarhas more than its fair share of them. Take the songMayangugiraal Oru Maadhu. It is meant for the newlyweds; Anand strums the sitar; Radha sings in the living room. An ill-at-ease Raju turns a framed picture of Radha and Anand away from the nuptial bed where his bashful wife awaits him. This awkward beginning to intimacy hints at what lies ahead\u2014two couples struggle to live harmoniously under the same roof. Though the story has its designated villains\u2014Anand\u2019s atthai and her son\u2014it is ultimately Raju\u2019s obsessive love for his sister that ruins everything. Overcome with sentiment, Raju impulsively signs away the rights to the house he built, handing it over to his sister\u2019s family.\n\nWhen Raju\u2019s financial situation deteriorates, Dr. Malathi is offered a scholarship to study abroad. Though she hesitates, Raju encourages her to go, convinced by Bhaskar that the change of scenery might restore Radha\u2019s spirits. Raju promises to care for their son but does a terrible job of it\u2014dragging the child along on a pilgrimage. He loses his eyesight and dies a blind pauper. Radha rushes to his hospital bedside, along with her daughter, only to collapse and die beside him. Meanwhile, Anand realizes how evil his atthai has been, and rushes out to beg Raju for forgiveness, but it is all too late.\n\nAs audiences in the 1960s stepped out of theaters, eyes brimming with tears,PasaMalarseemed to embody the essence of heartbreak; sacrifice and devotion to family is supreme. Watching it now, however, the film\u2019s ending offers an alternate reading\u2014 as a story where grief serves as a bridge to resilience. Instead of being consumed by sorrow, Dr. Malathi has a chance to transform her grief into a greater purpose\u2014dedicating herself to medicine and serving humanity beyond the confines of family.\n\n"
