  "full_review": "The story is about the close bond between a man and his young nephew, but there is a big logical loophole that makes it difficult to empathise with anything or anyone. The rest of this review may contain spoilers.\n\nMaamanis the latest entrant in the sub-genre we know as \u201cfamily drama set in southern Tamil Nadu\u201d. Soori plays Inba, who is very attached to his elder sister Girija (Swasika). The woman is childless for a long time, and when she finally becomes pregnant, Inba is delighted. He accompanies Girija to her first scan, he is the first one to listen to the baby\u2019s heartbeat, he is the first one to talk to the foetus when they find out it has developed ears \u2013 it\u2019s as though the father (Baba Bhaskar) is irrelevant. And in turn, the nephew, nicknamed Laddu (Prageeth Sivan), returns the favour. When Inba is marrying a doctor named Rekha (Aishwarya Lekshmi), Laddu sits between the couple. Laddu is used to sleeping with his uncle, so he accompanies the man to his wedding night. Laddu cannot bear to be apart from Inba, so there\u2019s no honeymoon.\n\nYou can read the rest of the review here:\n\nCopyright \u00a92025 GALATTA."
