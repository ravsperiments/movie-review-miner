  "full_review": "BySudharsanan Sampath\n\nI\u2019ve been watchingThug Life\u2018s promotional interviews, especially the one-on-one interviews with Mani Ratnam and Kamal Haasan. As expected, there are the usual questions aboutNayagan, about what it\u2019s like to reunite with this star or act alongside that person. Occupational hazard. My favorite interview of all this was Sudhir Srinivasan\u2019s interview with Mani Ratnam. (Sorry BR)I\u2019ve never seen the filmmaker this relaxed and willing to engage. And Sudhiralmostasked some of the questions I wanted to ask, but ultimately didn\u2019t. He skirted the line. Which got me thinking: if I ever have the opportunity to ask filmmakers like Mani Rathnam and Kamal Haasan some questions, what would I ask? These are a few off the top of my head.\n\nYou often speak about your guru K. Balachander, and about filmmakers like Bergman, Kurosawa, and others who\u2019ve shaped you as filmmakers. You\u2019ve both had immense box office success, and in Kamal Haasan\u2019s case, even opportunities likeBigg Boss. So I\u2019ll assume that money is secondary to filmmakers as respected and passionate as yourselves.\n\nThat said, why don\u2019t we see Tamil films likeWild Strawberries,Persona, orRan? Why don\u2019t we see honest, philosophical, existential explorations? Especially now, when a film likeWild Strawberriescould be made with a fraction of the budget of even a small Tamil film.\n\nWhy do you think such films remain so rare here? Apart from a few exceptions, like Manikandan\u2019s Kadaisi Vivasayi, or Lijo\u2019sNanpakal Nerathu Mayakkam, orTumbbad, even something likeThithifrom Kannada cinema, they\u2019re almost nonexistent.\n\nWhat is holding us back from making films that are personal, meditative, and artistically daring?\n\nTo Mani Ratnam:\n\nTo Mani Ratnam:\n\nI liked your answer in Sudhir\u2019s interview that you are always trying to reach toward the mastery of the films you admire, to close the gap between what you like and what you make. You spoke highly of Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s Roma, and even said you envy filmmakers who make films with honesty.\n\nWhat is stopping you from making films with the level of honesty you admire? We saw glimpses of that honesty inMouna Raagam,Nayagan,Kannathil Muthamittal,Bombay, and others. But why do you think your recent films lack that same honesty? And what do you think you can do to get there?\n\nTo Mani Rathnam:Just as a side note: My favorite film of yours is Raavanan with the fantastic Vikram as Raavanan. I am willing to die on that hill.\n\nTo Kamal Haasan:\n\nOne of my favorite passages in any Tamil film is the 40-minute Afghanistan sequence inVishwaroopam 1. I was blown away by what I was watching. Why didn\u2019t the entire film maintain that level of brilliance? And what do you think went wrong with the sequel?\n\nIf you had all the money in the world, with no pressure from the audience, the film community, or political powers, how wouldVishwaroopamlook? Can you explore that vision?\n\nTo Mani Ratnam and Kamal Haasan:\n\nWhen I look at films from around the world, I\u2019m always blown away by the sheer range of cinematic brilliance across genres, space exploration thrillers, psychological horrors, folk horror, military dramas, political thrillers, and science fictions. I\u2019m not referring to big budget, VFX heavy tentpole films, but more grounded, atmospheric works likeThe WailingorExhumafrom Korea,Under the Skin,Children of Men, or even something homegrown likeKantara.\n\nWould you be interested in exploring genres beyond gangster dramas and action sagas? For instance, I\u2019d love to see Kamal Haasan in a horror film likeBramayugam, or witness Mani Rathnam direct a slow burn paranoia thriller like theZodiacorMemories of Murder.\n\nWhat are the chances of something like that ever happening? Do these genres excite you creatively?\n\nTo Kamal Haasan and Mani Ratnam:\n\nIf money, audience expectations, the pressure of being a star, and political influence were no longer factors, what would your next films be? Genre, themes?\n\nTo Mani Ratnam:\n\nI love what you said about films with honesty. For example, I considerChildren of Heavenby Majid Majidi to be a spectacularly honest film. But when the same film was remade in Tamil asAkka Kuruvi, it was stripped of that honesty. It became more melodramatic and sentimental, with a rousing background score. For lack of a better term, it was \u201cTamilified.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t believe this is cultural and weneeda background score telling us how to feel, or scenes that tell instead of simply showing what\u2019s happening.\n\nWhat can future filmmakers learn from Iranian cinema or other honest films? And how can we begin to implement that kind of emotional restraint and authenticity in our own industry?\n\nTo Kamal Haasan:\n\nWhat is your favorite Sivaji Ganesan performance and why? You have to pick one?\n\nTo Mani Rathnam:\n\nWhat is the one film that made you feel jealous as a filmmaker? It could be any film from around the world.\n\nTo Kamal Haasan:\n\nIf Sivaji Ganesan and Nagesh were alive today and you are tasked to make a film with those two in the lead roles, what type of film would you make? Let us say they are both older. Thevar Magan Sivaji Ganesan, and Nammavar Nagesh for a reference."
