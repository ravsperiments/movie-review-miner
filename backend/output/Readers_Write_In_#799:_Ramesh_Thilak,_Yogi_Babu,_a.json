  "full_review": "ByAditi Subramaniam\n\nAs I write this, I am sitting in a Mexican restaurant waiting for my lunch to arrive. I must be hungry, because it\u2019s 3 pm and I haven\u2019t eaten anything since an early breakfast, but even the nachos and salsa in front of me, which would have ordinarily been gobbled up as soon as they arrived, remain hardly touched. Instead, I\u2019m on my phone, typing out this article because I just finished watchingTourist Family, and it has seized every functioning corner of my brain, including the lateral hypothalamus (the tiny part responsible for hunger, which is clearly on a break right now).\n\nI know thisTourist Familyhangover is going to last a while. WHAT. A. MOVIE. I feel slightly guilty that I\u2019m having to rely on a three word capitalized phrase to encapsulate what the movie made me feel, but oh well. Words fail me, I guess. Or maybe I\u2019m just hungry, and my enchiladas just arrived. I\u2019m going to say the latter is the case, and continue writing after I get back home. Maybe my satiated self will be able to muster up prose worth writing about.\n\nAlright, I\u2019m on the bus back home now, belly full and mind still reeling, but not necessarily from any of the characters fromTourist Family. Nope. I\u2019m thinking about Karunakaran\u2019s blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it cameo as the bus conductor inMeiyazhagan\u2013 a performance that had me grinning like a fool. Because that\u2019s the secret superpower of the so-called \u201cside characters\u201d \u2013 they sneak up on you, lodge themselves in your heart, and steal the show when you least expect it.\n\nSpeaking of wide smiles, I\u2019m now trying to pinpoint my biggest grin duringTourist Family. Was it when Ramesh Thilak popped up as a policeman with his heart in the right place? (Side note: Is there a more fitting role for Thilak? I think not. But then again, the man can slip into just about any role like he was born for it, so maybe this is a moot point.) Or was it when Yogi Babu was revealed as Simran\u2019s brother, emerging from beneath a tarp like a particularly startled bear? Or perhaps it was the simmering intensity of M.S. Bhaskar, berating his cook for serving Dharmadas and his brother-in-law tea in a disposable cup \u2013 a quiet but cutting reminder of the unspoken hierarchies that still haunt our everyday lives.\n\nAnd what of those actors you\u2019ve never seen before, but whose performance (in a role however \u201csmall\u201d), makes you go back home and google them in a feverish hurry? Mithun Jai Shankar and Yogalakshmi \u2013 playing the older son and Kural, his downstairs neighbor \u2013 left such a mark on my heart that they\u2019ve officially won my award for \u201cMost Impactful Romance in the Fewest Scenes.\u201d Theenakkaga kadal thaandi vandhescene, the intensity of which seemed to take them both by surprise, still gets me misty-eyed just thinking about it.\n\nOf course, this movie had its share of scenes that made me tear up, and how. I was grateful to be watching it in an almost empty theater on a Monday morning, free to ugly-cry like no one was watching (because, blessedly, no one was).\n\nAnd now, I\u2019m back home, tapping away at my laptop keyboard, thinking about the sister-in-law character inMeiyazhagan, played by Swathi \u2013 yet another actor I found myself frantically Googling as soon as the credits rolled. If actors were measured by the sheer impact of their performances rather than the number of lines they deliver (as they should be), Swathi would undoubtedly earn a top spot.\n\nThe same goes for Devadarshini Chetan, who deserves an award for practically every role she\u2019s ever taken on \u2013 the kind of actor who doesn\u2019t just step into a scene, but owns it, leaving an impression that lingers long after the screen fades to black. Together, they\u2019re perfect examples of performers who don\u2019t need the spotlight to shine.\n\nAnd here\u2019s a thought \u2013 is it just me, or does watching some of these actors on screen together, occupying the same cinematic universe, feel a bit like coming home? There\u2019s something comforting about seeing Ramesh Thilak, Bucks (ofNaduvula Konjam Pakkatha Kanomfame), Karunakaran, Bobby Simha, Devadarshini, Swathi, Yogalakshmi, Bala Saravanan, and of course, Vijay Sethupathi (who, despite his leading-man status, will always have \u201cside character\u201d energy in my heart) sharing the same frame in some combination or other. It\u2019s like a warm hug from an old friend \u2013 chaotic, comforting, and a little bit unexpected.\n\nAnd if Vijay Sethupathi ever reads this, I hope he knows I mean this as the highest compliment. Because if it were up to me, we\u2019d all aspire to have \u201cside character energy\u201d \u2013 to make the most of the time we\u2019re given, to steal the spotlight without ever seeking it, and to leave a mark so deep, the audience can\u2019t help but Google us in a feverish hurry.\n\nAnd if you ever need a reminder of why side characters are the real stars, just rewatchTourist Family. I promise you\u2019ll find your people."
