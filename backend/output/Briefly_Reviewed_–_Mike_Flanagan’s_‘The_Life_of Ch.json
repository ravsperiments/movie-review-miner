There are two lovely musical sequences, but \u2013 again \u2013 those are a part of Chuck\u2019s universe. There\u2019s this joke that it would be lovely if life unfolded in reverse: we begin with death and work our way back to middle-age and youth and robust childhood and end with the one magnificent orgasm that started it all.The Life of Chuckis that joke in movie form. I was moved beyond words. I ran to the theatre because it was the last day this film was playing in the city, and found that a few of our younger filmmakers had done the same thing. I was sitting next to one of them. After the movie, I asked him the question I hate to be asked after a movie: \u201cSo\u2026 what did you think?\u201d He smiled and said what I would have said: \u201cI am still processing it.\u201d A few days later, I am still processingThe Life of Chuck: not in terms of form (though, as always in this filmmaker\u2019s work, there are visual compositions and sound decisions that are to die for), but in terms of the larger implications of this story. John Donne wrote:No man is an island, / Entire of itself; / Every man is a piece of the continent, / A part of the main.Apparently, we are a part of the universe, too. Here\u2019s to the Chucks whose universes we are a part of, and the Chucks who are a part of ours."
