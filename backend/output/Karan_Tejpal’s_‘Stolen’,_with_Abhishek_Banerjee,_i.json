  "full_review": "The story gets going when a baby gets \u201cstolen\u201d, but along with the investigative thriller, we get a superb micro-portrait of the rich and the poor. The rest of this review may contain spoilers.\n\nKaran Tejpal\u2019sStolendives into its premise and its themes right from Scene One. The premise is spelt out in the title, and a baby is stolen from the arms of its mother. As for the themes, one of them is that this mother, Jhumpa (Mia Maelzer), is sleeping on a railway platform, while outside, we see a man sleeping in his closed cocoon of a luxury car. His name is Gautam (Abhishek Banerjee), and he is waiting for his brother Raman (Shubham). Why is Raman coming by train, and not flying in? It\u2019s a long story, but sometimes, the two Indias do meet, and when they do, it\u2019s fireworks. When Raman arrives, he is accused of stealing the baby, and Gautam jumps in and calls the accusers \u201cbloody savages\u201d, and the fuse is lit for an hour-and-a-half long stretch of violence, both physical and emotional.\n\nYou can read the rest of the review here:\n\nCopyright \u00a92025 GALATTA."
