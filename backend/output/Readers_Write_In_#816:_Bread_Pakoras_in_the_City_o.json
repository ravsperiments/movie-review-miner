  "full_review": "By Pranav Jain\n\nPranav Jain is an incoming civil servant and also a columnist.\n\n\u201cYeh Dilli hai mere yaar, bas ishq, mohabbat, pyaar\u201d.This is not merely a lyric from Rakeysh Mehra\u2019sDelhi-6,but a declaration. Delhi does not ask to be loved, it assumes it will be. There is, simply, no city quite like Delhi. It dreams inLove Aaj Kal\u2019sheritage conservation and curses inDelhi Heights\u2019traffic jams. That, perhaps, is why when Bollywood turns its gaze upon it, Delhi does not sit quietly in the background but spreads itself across the screen like Jagjit Singh\u2019sHoshwalon Ko Khabar Kya\u2013 innocently romantic, indelibly layered, and redolently fragrant with silent longing.\n\nConsider the Delhi ofKhosla Ka GhoslaandOye Lucky! Lucky Oye!. Dibakar Banerjee adroitly paints Delhi as a city bursting at the seams with working-class dreams and middle-class fears.\n\nInKhosla Ka Ghosla, Kamal Kishore Khosla (played by Anupam Kher), with his ill-fitting shirts and dad paunch, embodies the quintessential Punjabi middle-class Delhi-ite. The film captures the crumbling ethics of a Delhi in the throes of gentrification. In Banerjee\u2019s Delhi, the real villain is not Boman Irani\u2019s builder but Delhi itself, where land means legitimacy, and where your place in society is tied to the physical coordinates of your address.Oye Lucky!, on the other hand, is less a heist film than a sly commentary on how aspiration operates in Delhi. Abhay Deol\u2019s Lucky does not rob people out of desperation. He robs them out of contempt, and sometimes, out of curiosity. Lucky is the byproduct of a city obsessed with class performance, where the boundary between\u2018somebody\u2019and\u2018also-ran\u2019is often just a leather jacket and a cool car.\n\nPerhaps, Delhi has always been like that. In Yash Chopra\u2019sTrishul, many decades earlier, a similar struggle takes place, but on a grander scale. Amitabh Bachchan\u2019s Vijay, born illegitimate and angry, arrives in Delhi to reclaim what was taken from him \u2013 the empire that his father (Sanjeev Kumar) built. Against the brooding silhouette of\u00a0 Delhi\u2019s brutalist skyline, a masculine battle between father and son unfolds. All over a piece of property, a vestige of power, a sliver of recognition, and countless dramas of paternal issues. In some scenes, you can almost sense the city\u2019s post-emergency era anxieties being juxtaposed against boardroom battles.\n\nYet, Delhi is not all grit and testosterone. It is also lehengas and the sound of a shehnai which can cause tinnitus. Few films have captured this side of the city like Mira Nair\u2019sMonsoon Weddingand Maneesh Sharma\u2019sBand Baaja Baaraat.\n\nIn the former, Delhi explodes with colour and contradiction, amidst a great Indian wedding set in a farmhouse in Chattarpur. Delhi here typifies the tension between opulence and unresolved trauma. Mira Nair\u2019s Delhi is a city trying to be global while still clinging to the scent of marigolds and the sound of Mehdi Hassan\u2019sghazals. It is conflicted, but never cold.Band Baaja Baaraatintroduces us to a new Delhi. One that is ambitious and swears by itsBread Pakoras. Shruti and Bittoo, from different parts of the city \u2013 one from Subhash Nagar and the other from a more genteel class \u2013 hustle a wedding planning enterprise that is pure Dillijugaad. This is the Delhi of start-ups and breakups in DTC buses. A Delhi trying to grow up, but failing at adulting spectacularly.\n\nThe use of Delhi University (DU) and Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) as motifs has been a recurring trend in Bollywood movies. In Sai Paranjape\u2019sChashme Baddoor, the Delhi of the early \u201980s was innocent enough for bunked classes and romance with Miss Chamko among the historic locales of Talkatora. The city had not yet grown cynical. You could still flirt over chai, and run a tab on the cigarettes withLallan Miyan.\n\nBut Delhi changes every decade. That is perhaps its tragedy and also its glory. InFukrey, the city is younger and more alive than ever. The boys ofFukreyare not interested in studying or changing the world. They are just trying to earn a quick buck while working forBholi PunjabanfromJamnapaar, in order to impress the girl next door. Delhi here is hormonal and cheeky. And all the more charming for that. InRockstar, Ranbir Kapoor\u2019s transformation into Jordan begins in the North Campus. His angst is amplified by the city\u2019s indifference and his Devdas-like self-destruction finds a soundtrack in Rahman\u2019s sufi rock. And when Kundan follows Zoya from Varanasi to Delhi inRaanjhanaa, Kundan\u2019s obsession and idealism die a thousand deaths in the political cauldron of JNU.\n\nSometimes, the most accurate portrayal of Delhi comes from the margins.Delhi-6is set in the ancient lanes of Chandni Chowk, but it is not a period piece. It is an affectionate indictment of Delhi, one where communal amity and communal tensions exist in the same emotional arsenal.Titlipresents the city not as a location but as a lineage. The protagonist wants to escape the car-jacking family business, but soon realises that escape from Delhi remains a bourgeois fantasy. AndGhode Ko Jalebi Khilane Le Ja Riya Hoonis arguably the most radical and unsettling Delhi film. Through the dreams of pickpockets and street vendors, the film reconstructs an urban consciousness where modernity and sewage flow side by side.\n\nWhat binds these disparate films is their shared reverence for an irreverent Delhi. You can leave Delhi, love it, curse it, or romanticise it from far away, but you never really exit it. Bollywood, when it chooses to look beyond the sterile sets of Mumbai or the anachronistic charm of small-town milieus, finds in Delhi not just a location, but a canvas that is poetic, political, bruising, and forgiving, in equal measure."
