  "full_review": "The story is about two cops patrolling a small town, and the many things they encounter over the course of one night. But slowly, we become aware that some of these many things may be linked to a crime. The rest of this review may contain spoilers.\n\nShahi Kabir is the screenwriter ofJoseph,Officer on Duty, and the excellentNayattu. As director, we gotEla Veezha Poonchira, and now we haveRonth. All these films are stories about the police, and not just in the investigative sense. Shahi was in the force, and he wants us to see cops as human beings. They may wield power, they may wield a stick, but they can also be as vulnerable, as human as the rest of us. They worry that the government may slash their salary. A female cop asks her male colleague to step away while she makes a call home, because her husband is a suspicious man. Housewives who are seen with policemen are sometimes mistaken for sex workers who have been arrested. And even within the police ecosystem, a cop may find himself sacrificed so that the top brass can claim that justice has been done.\n\nYou can read the rest of the review here:\n\nCopyright \u00a92025 GALATTA."
