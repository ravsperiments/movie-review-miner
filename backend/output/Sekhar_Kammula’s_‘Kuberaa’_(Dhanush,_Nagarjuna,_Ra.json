  "full_review": "The story is about an evil, rich man who recruits a beggar for a job, and the film wants to be a fable with a moral about haves and have-nots. But the themes and ideas don\u2019t fit in easily, and the film ends up occasionally engaging at best. The rest of this review may contain spoilers.\n\nSekhar Kammula\u2019s new film is named after the Hindu god of wealth, and it is a story of haves and have-nots. Sekhar explored this zone in a lighter vein inLife is Beautiful,but this time, he is dead serious.Kuberaaopens with oil being found in the sea. Does this belong to all of India (i.e., can it be used to benefit the country), or can it be used to make a few rich men even richer? Jim Sarbh plays the rich villain, Neeraj. He wants it all, like we hear in the lyrics for Devi Sri Prasad\u2019s \u2018Trance of Kuberaa\u2019. On the other hand, we have the poorest of the poor, the people who beg. Dhanush plays Deva, a beggar in Tirupati who ends up in Neeraj\u2019s orbit for a reason he does not know. He is recruited for a job. He does not know that this job comes with a death sentence.\n\nYou can read the rest of the review here:\n\nCopyright \u00a92025 GALATTA."
