  "full_review": "ByVijaysree V\n\nIt was a nippy December evening. Festivity was in the air. From our uptown campus, we took the streetcar to go gawk at the twinkling lights and dressed up store fronts in downtown New Orleans. On Canal Street, a tall black man, dressed as Santa Claus tinkled out a steady tune with his handbell, urging passersby to deposit money in the red kettle for the Salvation Army. Ho, ho, ho! My first semester of graduate school in the U.S. had ended. I had done well in my final exams. My research grade was a definite A, though I had not produced anything publishable yet. Like most desi graduate students, I practically lived in the lab and did my professor\u2019s bidding, which sent all the right signals.\n\nFinally, I was outside in the fresh air now.\u00a0 The weather had turned cooler. My breath did not frost over in this subtropical clime, nor did my cheeks turn visibly pink, which would a physiological impossibility for a south Indian like me even in northernmost Alaska.\u00a0 But I felt cold, despite my puffy jacket, and dug my hands into the warm pockets. Men in dark suits, from the office buildings nearby, hurried along shopping for presents, to be nicely wrapped and handed to their loved ones in person. This was like being in a nice, holiday-themed film, but I was only watching \u2013 I was not in it.\n\nSilver bells, silver bellsIt\u2019s Christmas time in the cityRing-a-ling (ring-a-ling),Hear them ring (ting-a-ling)Soon it will be Christmas day.\n\nLooking at shoppers who were rushing home with their treasures as the song said, I realized \u2013 I had no idea when I would see my parents next. I couldn\u2019t even call them whenever I felt like it. It was much too expensive to call India on a weekday. Within the U.S. too, long-distance calls were cheaper in off-peak hours. After 9 PM, I could call my brother who was a graduate student in much colder Cleveland. After a while, we headed back uptown where we lived. Behind us, the songs of the season continued to spill out of the department stores with the heavy revolving doors.\n\nOut of sheer habit, the next morning, I pedaled to campus, shackled my bright metallic green bike to the rack, and went into the near-empty building which housed the chemistry department. My Canadian research advisor would not be in; my American classmates had all gone home for the holidays. One by one, I weighed the reagents, and added them into clean, dry glassware. I assembled the equipment. Once the reaction got going, it didn\u2019t need to be monitored for the next three hours.\u00a0 I logged in to check my email. Because I had already turned in the grades for the lab section of Chem 101 lab \u2014 I was a teaching assistant \u2013 I could goof off to my heart\u2019s content. That afternoon, surfing at leisure on the slow-speed internet, I stumbled on the writings of Ramesh Mahadevan.\n\nWait a minute, I thought! I lived in an apartment with three other desis, and the place had previously housed four other desis. How far back did that chain go? And as a matter of fact, all the furniture, including the bed I slept in, and the television set were all inherited from the previous renters. The microwaveable dinner set, and the pots and pans were hand-me-downs too. Only my clothes, and a few personal effects, were my own. I had accepted the other essentials without a moment of reflection. Imagine a newcomer having to buy, or rent, all this on her own penny in the first semester! Passing down gold is a common practice among women in desi families, but these guys seemed to pass on all their possessions.\n\nThe author had written about the desi graduate student subculture in ethnographic detail back in the 1980s in a series of text-based posts on internet newsgroups. Some kind soul had posted the compendium on a webpage. The stories, based on facts, were exaggerated for laughs. I chortled.\n\nA Chinese student in the lab next door peeked in to see what was happening \u2013 nothing, I said, and went right back to reading. (The Chinese graduate students should have their own Ramesh Mahadevan to chronicle their experience, I thought generously. They were a close-knit bunch and surely, they had their own weird traditions.)\u00a0 The deserted department, with the thrum of analytical instruments in the background, turned into a cozy haven that winter break as I happily followed the adventures of a character, a stand in for all Indian graduate students in America \u2013 a made-up character with a made-up last name.\n\nAjay Palvayanteeswaran never felt so ashamed of himself in his entire life. He felt as useless as a pizza coupon that was way past its expiry date. Why, he felt exactly like a seven-layer burrito that was missing two layers. In fact, his self-esteem hadn\u2019t reached such a rock-bottom since that fateful day when he took his departmental \u2018hot chick\u2019 on a dinner date and discovered at the end of the day that his fly had been open the entire evening. Why does he bring such things upon himself? Why do stories get written about him?\n\nSo impressionable was Palvayanteeswaran that \u201che bunked work the next week and rushed straight to the library and snatched the Wall Street Journal right out of the hands of a business prof.\u201d Imagine the cheek! He fantasized about getting out of the lab, doing well in the real world, and being magnanimous to his research advisor Prof. Ringo Rangopadhyay, who by then would surely be out of work what with Newt Gingrich\u2019s oft-repeated threats to cutting federal funds for science research in universities. (This \u201ccutting federal funds\u201d is an old game.)\n\nThis delightful compilation of Ramesh Mahadevan\u2019s writing, at that point, was more valuable to me than all the books in the humanities section of our campus library. When I gathered the courage to email the author, he wrote back using my first name \u2013 from the very first time \u2013 and it was like hearing back from an old friend!\n\nEpilogue\n\nWhen I met him in India in early 2006, he was only ten minutes late for our lunch appointment \u2013 I told you the man exaggerates. India was booming economically, and we had plenty to talk about. He was an adjunct professor at the SSN College of Engineering and taught Productions and Operations Management. Though he was single and had no children of his own, he had a surrogate family of underprivileged kids whose education he sponsored, and he was proud of them. \u201cI spend a good part of my weekends teaching them Laplace\u2019s transforms and \u2018spoken\u2019 English. It is such a pleasure to see every positive step these children take. I wish I could write more about my experience. But it is too personal,\u201d he posted.\n\nOnce the humorist had settled into his Chennai life, he had planned to focus on his creative writing. Sadly, his muse seemed to be on strike in India. He did write \u201chalf a script\u201d for a Tamil movie calledAchcham Thavir, starring Madhavan, Jothika, Nassar, Prakash Raj, Shobhana et al. It was abandoned \u201cthree quarters of the way through\u201d because the producer had run out of funds. \u201cThey are all very intelligent, very nice, on top being extremely talented,\u201d he said of the actors. He had seen the rushes and said that the actors, even in the bit roles, had interpreted their characters well. Did Kollywood come calling after this stalled effort? I don\u2019t know and I am very embarrassed to say this: I lost touch with my long-distance mentor."
