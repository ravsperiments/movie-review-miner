My response to Sara:\n\nSara: Why do you believe everything anyone says on the internet and why do you feel the need to bring this to my attention?\n\nI find it interesting that people want to delve more into other people\u2019s motives and intentions \u2014 \u2018cinema journalism\u2019 has basically become gossip and innuendos, I guess.\n\nAnd if this gentleman thinks my THUG LIFE review is a positive one, then what can I say!"
