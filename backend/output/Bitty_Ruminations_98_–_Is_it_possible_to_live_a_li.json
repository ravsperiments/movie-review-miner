  "full_review": "I have read many books about Orson Welles, seen many interviews. I have rarely met anyone so willing to open up \u2013 but this is not about Welles or even about cinema.\n\nThis is about the condition we call \u201cno regrets\u201d. There are times I look back and do the whole \u201cwhat if I had chosen this path instead of that one\u201d, but this isveryrare and I truly am not impacted by the past \u2014 so much so that I don\u2019t think I \u201clearn from my mistakes\u201d. I keep repeating some patterns and subsequently realise that \u201cbeen there, done this, why are you doing it again\u201d!\n\nBut I do know many people who have deep, deep regrets. They nurse these regrets and keep revisiting those times. I wonder how they carry on, how they step into each present day with this big burden of the past. Maybe you carry regrets of your life does not work out as you wanted it?\n\nI mean, almost nobody has a \u201cperfect life\u201d or has made the most perfect choices, but maybe some of us (in the present) really yearn for a time machine to fix something that would make things better?"
