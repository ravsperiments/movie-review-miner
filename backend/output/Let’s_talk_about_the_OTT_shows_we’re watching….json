  "full_review": "Starting a thread for OTT shows / recommendations etc.\n\nWhat have you guys been watching? As for me\u2026\n\nWhile waiting for the new season ofYou, which I am watching now, I asked around for recommendations.The new season ofThe Last of Usis something I desperately want to watch, but I want the whole season to drop \u2014 and not watch it on a weekly basis. So\u2026 what now? I started watchingThe White Lotusa while ago, but gave up midway through SIE1. It wasn\u2019t that Idislikedit, but I felt it was too lightweight for my then-mood, and wanted something heavier. But when my producer recommended it again, recently, I said \u201cwhy not\u201d \u2013 and this time, I really got into it. I think the biggest achievement of the show is in balancing a breezy tone (which I earlier dismissed as \u201clightweight\u201d) with dark truths about people and relationships. It\u2019s an \u201ceasy watch\u201d \u2014 and yet, it\u2019s more than an easy watch. Some portions made me pause and rewind and rewatch, and I seriously did not expect this much \u201ctruth\u201d in a show like this. Note to self, if still needed:Always keep your mind open.\n\nReproducing (from IMDb) one particular stretch of dialogue that I kept rewatching, with my favourite parts in bold:\n\n[Ethan has just told Daphne he thinks something happened between Cameron and Harper. After he tells her this, Daphne briefly mulls over the situation, her demeanor going into a troubled state at first, but ending in an air of unflappability]\n\nDaphne : [to Ethan] I don\u2019t think you have anything to worry about.\n\n[Ethan gives a confused look]\n\nDaphne: I mean, we never really know what goes on in people\u2019s minds or what they do, right? You spend every second with somebody and there\u2019s still this part that\u2019s a mystery. You know?You don\u2019t have to know everything to love someone. A little mystery? It\u2019s kinda sexy.\n\n[Ethan cracks a smile]\n\nDaphne: I\u2019m a mystery to myself. Honestly, I surprise myself all the time.I think you just\u2026 you just\u2026 do whatever you have to do not to feel like a victim of life.You know? Just use your imagination.\n\nPS:Comedy-wise, laughed way too \u2018hard\u2019 at this:\n\nAlbie: No girl should have to be exposed to an old guy\u2019s junk.\n\nAlbie\u2019s grandfather: It\u2019s not like it was ever so beautiful to look at anyway.I mean, it\u2019s a penis. It\u2019s not a sunset.\n\nPPS: Next up,Secrets We Keep, a six-episode Danish crime-thriller that I heard is quite good."
