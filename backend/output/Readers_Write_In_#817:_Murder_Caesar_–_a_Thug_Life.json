  "full_review": "By Srinath Lalgudi\n\nAs I thought about headline options for this piece, I went through the myriad thoughts & emotions this movie created in me and the one word that stood out again and again was \u2013 \u2018Unearned\u2019. Starting from what this movie wanted to make the audience feel and ending with the deluge of exaggerated social media hate it is receiving.\n\nI know KH has said this was based on his script that MR took inspiration from and reimagined. But after watching this movie, this is what I think happened \u2013\n\nKH wanted to make a movie like Kill Bill (which may end up being his next one with Anbariv), a stylized martial arts inspired actioner that has an aging don being betrayed by his underlings, only to survive his assassination attempt, recover with brewing vengeance and return to massacre all his attackers. (or \u2018Kill\u2019 with mainly kung fu and an Anime vibe)\n\nMR read this, focusing mainly on the betrayal part that appealed to his EQ, thought what if the \u2018baba mar gaya\u2019 boy from Nayagan was not specially abled and was instead kept alongside the guilty don, eventually encountering emotional turmoil and becoming a self-righteous betrayer which reminded him of Brutus from Julius Caesar and bam! He was hooked due to his penchant for retelling epics.\n\nKill Bill by KH and Julius Caesar by MR are both movies I would love to see as separate films where they have their respective appropriate tonology to earn the payoffs they want to give viewers. But alas, they tried to make something different just for the sake of being different and decided to mash them together and make \u2018Murder Caesar`. They both fall in love with this concept, fresh off their individual successes in the past few years (INDIAN 2 was more a Shankar failure for me) with their respective ages catching up to them, they think this would be a different enough movie to come back together after 38 years.\n\nThus begins the smashing together of these 2 story blocks and they keep trying to make them stick together with spit, snot, flum, sweat and maybe even a little blood hoping the adhesive powers within these are enough. Unfortunately, just as a doctor cannot diagnose/treat himself, they fail to realise this will not be a successful amalgam as this improvised glue is flaky at best.\n\nThe whole time I was watching this film, I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling of watching two completely different films that just had its scenes shuffled and then interleaved again by the director and editor. This split brain nature of things I believe was felt very much by ARR when he saw the film before all of us and his background score reflects his confusion. In his effort to aid the viewer with his music, he inadvertently ends up highlighting the very dissonance he hoped to remove with his melodies. MR says ARR takes care of a lot when he composes a musical landscape for a film, so in this case ARR has tried to unsuccessfully cover up for the director\u2019s faltering plot landscape blindspot.\n\nBR says MR/KH believe in show, don\u2019t tell. I am sorry to say, this movie is very much not that. Almost every needed, important plot detail is mostly told to us, never shown. No payoff is earned. I have listed points below wherein I may suggest cliches as possible solutions but I tried to remain within the scope of what the plot of the movie was trying to convey.\n\nThe only moments in the movie that rang true for me were few, but within them was the truly betrayed soul of a movie I would love to watch:\n\nBR mentioned in one of his comment replies about a \u201csalvaged script\u201d. If that is true, if all these unearned aspects of the movie are mostly because of additions after the script was locked leading to just damage control being the final goal when the movie was being put together on the edit table, is that not a complete mismanagement and failure in part of both the artists in question when they are at statures where they have the most control?\n\nHere is where I also start to question the other creative producers Siva Ananth, Shaad Ali, Bejoy Nambiar, Mahendran on this project, did they drink the Kool-Aid and fail MR & KH?\n\nPerhaps they could have called out their respective emperor but not when there were 2 towering giants/sacred cows amongst them who have previously made unexpected things work beautifully and no one could scream out that they have no clothes on this time around?\n\nOne last thought as I try to bring this rant to an end, paraphrasing here \u2013 MR is asked close to the beginning of BR\u2019s interview, \u201cWhen during the shoot did you realize this movie is finally shaping up the right way\u201d and MR says \u201cif it happens during the shoot it is too late, it has to happen at the idea stage\u201d.\n\nHow I wish someone at that stage had stepped up over there and spoken out before it was too late\u2026..sigh\u2026"
