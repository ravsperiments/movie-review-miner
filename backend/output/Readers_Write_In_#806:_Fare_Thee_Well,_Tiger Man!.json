  "full_review": "ByMadan Mohan\n\nLegendary conservationist Valmik Thapar passed away on 31stMay. He was 73 and had been suffering from cancer. Some say nobody did more than him for the tiger.\n\nOther than trips to Sanjay Gandhi National Park and the boat ride at Thekkady (which takes you into Periyar Tiger Reserve, really and where I did see a herd ofgaurby the riverbank), I have precious little to show for my self-proclaimed wildlife love.\u00a0 It is after moving to Harare for work that I was finally able to visit a national park (Zambezi) where I got to see a bunch of animals (though not the big one \u2013 lion).\n\nBut it\u2019s true and it dates back to my school days.\u00a0 Those who knew me then would know this side of me well and maybe even remember it with not a little irritation.\u00a0 And I heard about Thapar in the late 90s.\n\nYou\u2019d think I was a natural fan of his but it didn\u2019t quite pan out that way.\u00a0 I found him very tiger-obsessed (duh!).\u00a0 I was much more of a lion guy (still am in some ways if only because the Asiatic lion remains one epidemic away from an extinction event).\n\nI don\u2019t remember the program anymore but a journalist asked him why he focused so much on the tiger when there were so many endangered animals in India.\u00a0 His explanation was pragmatic to the core \u2013 tigers are only found in abundance where there are large water sources.\u00a0 And such water sources naturally support a plethora of fauna.\u00a0 So, you save the tiger, you save an ecosystem.\n\nTrue enough but it\u2019s equally true that he did love tigers like they were his own.\u00a0 How he managed to thread the needle, to love them madly but to also respect their immense strength and not cross over into Timothy Treadwell-like lunacy, I will never know.\n\nIf you have read any of his books or watched his documentaries, it is impossible to not quickly become aware of the extent of his tiger-love.\u00a0 I loved reading hisSecret Life of Tigers, its scope being encyclopaedic about all things tiger and Ranthambore.\u00a0 It was also graced by the brilliant photography of the late Fateh Singh Rathore.\u00a0 Rathore was there at Ranthambore from the get-go, from the beginning of Project Tiger in 1973.\u00a0 You could say the same about Rathore \u2013 nobody did more for the tigers of Ranthambore than Rathore.\u00a0 And Rathore was Thapar\u2019s mentor!\n\nWith conservation becoming rapidly re-centralized, like nearly everything else, in the last ten years, Thapar\u2019s roar had been diminished long before it had been silenced.\u00a0 He was barely heeded to anymore.\u00a0 Time will tell whether he was justified in his objections to the reintroduction of cheetah in Kuno National Park.\n\nBut whether or not those in power agreed with him anymore, they will nevertheless have to concede that there were/are few champions of the tiger who were as enthusiastic and as indefatigable.\u00a0 It was a lifelong mission for him.\u00a0 Is there somebody else who will pick up the torch from him to similarly make it their lifelong mission?\u00a0 And will that somebody actually come from his kind of background \u2013 Thapar family and married to Sanjana Kapoor?\n\nThink about that.\u00a0 You\u2019d take Thapar for a typical, privileged Delhi socialite if you didn\u2019t know how obsessed he was with the fate of wild tigers in India. May there be many more like him.\u00a0 Fare thee well, tiger man!"
