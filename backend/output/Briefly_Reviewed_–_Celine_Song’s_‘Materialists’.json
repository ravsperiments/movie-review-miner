  "title": "Briefly Reviewed \u2013 Celine Song\u2019s \u2018Materialists\u2019",
  "summary": "Celine Song seems to have wanted to move away fromPast Lives. Her new film is more mainstream and (thankfully) more messy, both in terms of structure and in terms of what it talks about. I wasn\u2019taswowed byPast Livesthe way many of my friends were. I found ittooneat,tooconstructed,tooperfect. Every bit of silence hung in the air just so. I liked the film, but I think I likedMaterialistsmore. On the surface, it is a love triangle where a girl has a rich man on one arm and a struggling-to-make-ends-meet man on the other. But scratch this surface, and this could also be a tug of war between art and commerce: one of the suitors is in finance, the other is a theatre actor. The words \u201cvaluable\u201d and \u201cworthless\u201d are used to describe the effects of love, and marriage is described as a \u201cbusiness\u201d. Yeah, there is a reason this story is called what it\u2019s called.",

Yeah, there is a reason this story is called what it\u2019s called.\n\nThere are many things that did not click for me: like the \u201cawww\u201d ending, or the flashback to cavemen. I don\u2019t think close-up \u201ccute\u201d is Celine Song\u2019s thing. But when she gazes at her characters from a distance, she brings an amazing clarity and curiosity \u2013 she\u2019s something of a social scientist who\u2019s trying to figure out Friendship Day and Valentine\u2019s Day and these other \u201crituals\u201d we hold on to in order to celebrate the people around us because we don\u2019t want to die alone. But what about theinnerrituals, the ones only we know about, like how we change our bodies because we don\u2019t like how we look and we know that others are going to judge us for these \u201cdeficiencies\u201d? I adore rom-coms, butMaterialistsis more than that. Its construct resembles that of a rom-com but it also comes with a ton of veryfeltpain. Instead of writing a screenplay around characters, the film makes us feel that these characters are drifting along, writing their own screenplay. They are messy, so is the film, which has brilliant high points along with moments that made me go\u2026 \u201creally?\u201d I was riveted."
