  "full_review": "By Karthik Amarnath\n\nAll ye fine people of this blog who call yourselves fans of Mani Ratnam and yet unabashedly dislikedThug Life, I only have one question for you. Where\u2019s the loyalty, folks? Don\u2019t the hours and hours of watching and rewatching his movies mean anything?\n\nAnd you, you, you, that guy, that guy who spent hours talking to Mani and even wrote that book..whatchamacallit\u2026Condensations with\u2026Commiserations with....Complications with..? yeah whatever\u2026Didn\u2019t you write \u201cHow do you say no to the man who madeNayakan?\u201d Well, the man who madeNayakanhas now made a film with the star ofNayakan. That after thirty seven years! And what did you do? From that Ambi payyan who couldn\u2019t say no, you now became the cool bro who says uhhnn\u2026.. what\u2019s that word\u2026.Underwhelmed? Underwhelmed, by the way, is a lot worse, a whole lot worse than saying no.\n\nTsk. Tsk. Tsk. Sad. Sad.\n\nYou know when I last felt this sad? Three weeks ago, when I graded my class final exams. Hours and hours of pouring my heart out for every lecture, every assignment, every office hour, and what do I get. Even the brilliant first bencher whose wide eyed curiosity alone would make up for all the groans and yawns, he turns in a paper that left me uhn, uhnn..\u2026 what\u2019s that word again\u2026.. underwhelmed!\n\nLet me say this. I am not that professor who\u2019s always at meetings complaining about \u201call the darned kids these days.\u201d I\u2019m the guy who goes back to my notes, revises them, sees whats exciting today, understand where students are today, try to meet them half-way. If not half way, then three-quarters, or even seven-eights, if thats what it takes. There was a time I used to give 10 questions in an exam. Then it became seven. Then five. Now I give three. Just three. Sure, there\u2019s going to be some sub-plots, I mean, sub-parts. After all it\u2019s a three hour movie, I mean, exam. You\u2019d think that should do the trick. But no. By the time kids get to the third act, apparently they\u2019ve already given up.\n\nSo you know what I do now? I let them have cheat sheets. It used to be one sheet. Then it became two. And now it\u2019s three. After all, kids shouldnt be expected to remember the equations for stochastic gradient descent and matrix factorization and complementary slackness and principal component projection and all that. And we best just ignore the fact that you can derive any equation if you want, especially if you paid attention, and put some thought, and there\u2019s enough time to think given its a three hourmovieexam, and whatever, OK, whatever\u2026. enough about my work life. I want to talk aboutThug Life!\n\nIn case it wasn\u2019t already obvious, I loved it. Literally, Spiritually, Geometrically, Atmospherically. I loved it.\n\nNow for those of you who didn\u2019t, here\u2019s what I am going to do. I\u2019m going to give you a cheat sheet. Or three. Or five.\n\nSPOILERS AHEAD FOR THUG LIFE\n\n#1: Its literally there in the name(s): Thug Life\n\nDont people read anymore? Thug and life are two words. Two. different. words.Thug Lifehas two. different. worlds. One is the world of people who want to have a life. Their clothes are loose fitting, hair unkempt, to let all the randomness of life fill them. The other is the world of people who fight to survive, aka thugs. They have cleanly combed hair, and wear tight chested clothes, as though one wrong fold could kill them.\u00a0 Velu Nayakan, once a little boy who wore a loose fitting banyan, just wanted a life but the world turned him into a thug, the OG thug. But now we have Vinveli Nayagan, a space-age thug, and he wants to have both. He could have just had a life aka Jeeva, but no, he still went after the thrill of meeting Death in different forms, and a bar dancer who had a different name every day. Are you still wondering why he keeps playing the name calling game with her? As to what they do together, as colorfully described by Pechiamma, isnt that often compared to the thrill of dying and being reborn?\n\n#2: Eye in the sky: It\u2019s a bird, a plane, it\u2019s the Lightning Queen\n\nThe bar dancer does have a real name. One completely apt for although never used by the space thug. Indrani, named after the God of lightning. (Details about God are in cheat sheet #4). What\u2019s lightning\u2014 just brightened short bursts of light that shock you and disappear instantly although you can feel its effects even after. Like an orgasm, or like a near death experience. Lightning only shows up in the night. Like a bar dancer. Or like the moon. Like Chandra, the moon who could have lit up Amaran\u2019s dark times. Now ask yourself why Amaran who was denied moonlight was so drawn to Ms. lightning, and why he always called her by her real name?\n\n#3: Its basic geometry\n\nIf you\u2019ve never taken a grade-level math class, I\u2019m afraid Mani Ratnam movies are not for you. A Mani movie with no parallels is like\u2026uhm\u2026uhm\u2026a movie made by someone else. Remember Kundavai and Nandini each walking around with a sword to Vandiyathevan\u2019s neck in PS-2, and remember that they were both disarmed by him. If you\u2019re the kind who asks why did Kundavai have to go through all that drama when dancing to a dream song in Aga Naga would have done just fine, well then, go take a\u2026geometry class.\n\nThe parallel lines in Thug Life are between two Amarans. One is an \u201cAmaran\u201d who just doesn\u2019t die, and the other is just named Amaran. When one keeps himself busy dying \u201clittle deaths\u201d in jail with his Lightning Queen, the other would rather make a deal to remove the biggest threat to their lives (and not have to cheat Death any more). They\u2019re both raised by \u201celder brothers.\u201d They both push their \u201celder brothers\u201d off railings. The \u201cAmaran\u201d is on a beach going after his life/wife that\u2019s forgotten him while the one named Amaran is on a beach asking to wed the lightning queen who doesn\u2019t quite embrace him. (She in fact keeps talking past him) Are you still surprised that a life of living dangerously does not embrace him either?\n\n#4: God, it\u2019s so basic!\n\nYou know how people complain that they\u2019re done with predictable films. Apparently these days everyone wants real twists (as if back in the day, we only wanted theAnbe Vaasong). Anyway, let me take you to a scene where the one named Amaran waits outside the temple while the Alwarpet \u201cAmaran\u201d prays inside for forgiveness. Is there a bigger twist than a Kamal Hassan character in a Mani Ratnam movie believing in the OG Andavar?\n\nAnd he\u2019s not just any believer. He\u2019s the guy who will travel to the heights of Mount Kailash and absolve himself of all his sins (btw, if you didnt catch him folding his hands, you need to keep your phone on sleep mode). And his sins do get absolved. Just as he rises slowly from the icy cold depths of having been betrayed by his brethren, and takes a long hard road to absolution at the abode of Lord Shiva, his wife has been saved by a certain Shiva Raja in a near death experience. And the daughter who had once miscarried could now have a child. The Alwarpet Andavar who sinned for survival and some for pleasure is reborn as an avenging avatar of the immortal Bodhidharma. (While Mr. Atman continued to be the atheist)\n\n#5: Have you been sleeping??\n\nI often ask obvious questions in class to see who\u2019s been sleeping. So, here\u2019s one. What\u2019s common toThenpandi Cheemayile, Chinna Thayaval, andAnju Vanna Poove? Yes, they\u2019re lullabies. And then? Well they\u2019re lullabies in Mani movies with big stars. Sure, and then? They\u2019re lullabies in Mani movies with big stars playing lawless characters. Yes, yes, and what else? They\u2019re lullabies in Mani movies with big stars playing lawless characters who grew up without their parents. Excellent!\n\nAnju Vanna Pooveis very conspicuously used in Thug Life to call back to the parental love that Amaran lost. Just asThenpandiwas used as a song of comfort during the dark times of Velu Nayakan, andChinna Thayavalfor Surya. All their endings reunite them with that lost parent, that lost life. InThug Life, it\u2019s not just the song, there\u2019s the location, and there\u2019s that chalk outline of Amaran\u2019s father. Now think about the position we see Amaran in when he finally meets Chandra.\n\nOk, so now, the enthu cutlets among you are going to throw me a gotcha\u2014 But what about Rangaraya Shaktivel? Didnt he lose his parents too? How come he doesn\u2019t get to \u201creunite\u201d with them? Aha!\n\nOk, ok, you got me there, but let me ask you this\u2014 who\u2019s that woman, that only woman who has slapped him? Who\u2019s that only woman who calls him \u201cDei Shaktivel!\u201d When she says that aloud at the very end, who does she think she\u2019s calling out to? A grown man?\n\n\u2014\u2014-\n\nYou know, there are times I think I should do away with cheat sheets, and just be a stuffed shirt, a real thug, who\u2019ll give the hardest tests, and laugh as my students struggle. Would do them well to learn some survival skills for when they go out to the real world. But then, you see them, and in your mind, you have that picture of kids in loose fitting shirts with all the room for hopes and dreams, and you hope in turn that there\u2019s also room for what you have to offer. And there always is, and despite all the distractions we have stuffed ourselves tightly with, you try hard enough, there always is room for deeper engagement.\n\nBut ask me again a few years from now, when our kids are looking for \u201cprompt sheets\u201d so they can CheatGPT their way through life, then I might just start shining some thug light.\n\n"
