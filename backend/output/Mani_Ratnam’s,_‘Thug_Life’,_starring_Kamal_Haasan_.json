  "full_review": "The concept is solid: a man keeps trying to avoid death, and death keeps coming at him in every direction. But despite strong filmmaking, the narrative remains emotionally aloof. The rest of this review may contain spoilers.\n\nMani Ratnam and Kamal Haasan have repeatedly stressed that their reunion afterNayakanhas nothing to do with that earlier film. They are right. There are a few images, a few touches that reminded me ofNayakan. Trisha (named Indrani) plays a version of the girl who is \u201csaved\u201d from a life of sex work. Silambarasan (as Amaran) plays a version of a boy who thinks his father has been killed by his mentor; he\u2019s essentially a more ferocious variation on the boy who kept saying \u201cbaba mar gaya\u201d. Plus, as a lost little boy, we see Amaran in an oversized shirt (like inNayakan), as he loses his father and is \u201cadopted\u201d by another father. Kamal Haasan is named Sakthivel, as is his grandson. The idealistic cop played by Nasser inNayakanfinds a kind of reflection in the idealistic cop played by Ashok Selvan; only, this cop is after bad guys across the board. He\u2019s not just after criminals but also the crooks in the government.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thematic difference.Nayakanwas an examination of good and bad, whether being oppressed meant that you could take the law into your own hands, even if it was to help your fellow-oppressed. The philosophy at the core was direct, and the questions it raised were emotionally affecting.Thug Life, on the other hand, is more abstract. It\u2019s the story of a man who constantly battles with death \u2013 he even battles with his own death, at a point when he is betrayed. Sakthivel\u2019s opening monologue talks about Yama, the god of death, and both literally and figuratively (i.e., in the form of loss), this film is filled with death: the death of a brother, the death of a mother (stated but not shown), the death of a lover, the death of a son, the death of an innocent father in a shootout, the death of a wife\u2019s memory, the death of trust\u2026\n\nYou can read the rest of the review here:\n\nCopyright \u00a92025 GALATTA."
