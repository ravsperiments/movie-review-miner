  "full_review": "By Caesium\n\nThug Life invariably made me think about other gangster movies, specifically those done by Kamal. And no, notNayagan, butVasool Raja MBBS. These are two distinctly different brands of thugs, and I\u2019m in no doubt on which camp I preferred.\n\nFirst, we have our eponymous Vasool Raja MBBS. This wasn\u2019t your garden-variety goon. Oh no. This gentleman was practically a walking, talking, emotionally aware hug in gangster\u2019s clothing. The inventor of \u201ckattipudi vaithiyam\u201d (which, for the uninitiated, sounds suspiciously like a therapeutic wrestling move), Vasool Raja oozed warmth. He was the underdog you desperately wanted to win, a chaotic good force wrapped in a slightly threatening exterior. The filmmakers clearly knew how to pull at our heartstrings. We had the Carrom Board Thatha, a living demo of mind-over-matter and probably some killer carrom moves. We had Wheelchair Ananth, whose coming-back-from-coma story brought a tear or two to even the most hardened cynic. And then, the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance: the Raja\u2019s father, whose dignity is shattered when Raja\u2019s career is exposed to him, prompting an outpouring of audience sympathy for our lovable rogue. You couldn\u2019t help but root for this guy, even if his methods involved a bit of forceful persuasion. It was \u201chug life\u201d all the way, folks.\n\nNow, the cinematic whiplash. Enter \u201cThug Life.\u201d The character had no redeeming quality \u2013 cheating on Abhirami, suspecting Simbu. You\u2019d think a movie with such a bold title would deliver a character you could at least begrudgingly respect, if not connect. Nope, too many holes and logic failures. Why wasn\u2019t Nasser at the helm, despite being the elder one? Why did Simbu not confront Kamal with Nasser\u2019s acquisitions? Small fillers (like a note about Delhi\u2019s history) may be fine as ornamental subtexts, but core reasons needed to be strong (not flimsy or filmy).\n\nOn an unrelated note, was \u201cThug Life\u201d a retelling of \u201cRetro\u201d from Joju George\u2019s character? You know, the one who seemed to be strategically employing an adopted child as an armour or army? Regardless, neither worked for me.\n\nSo, what\u2019s my takeaway from this odyssey? Perhaps that even in the realm of cinematic crime, relatability and a touch of heart can go a long way. While \u201cThug Life\u201d left me feeling disconnected and wasted, \u201cVasool Raja MBBS\u201d, two decades later, still elicits laughter and love.\n\nPS: No accident that Tourist Family \u2013 a story about struggles of an immigrant family \u2013 was welcomed with both arms open, when presented with laughter and love!"
