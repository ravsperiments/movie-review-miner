  "full_review": "Aamir Khan plays a basketball coach who is asked to train a team of special-needs people. Everything is very broad and generic, but the feel-good factor holds it all together. The rest of this review may contain spoilers.\n\nIn RS Prasanna\u2019sSitaare Zameen Par, Aamir Khan plays a man-child named Gulshan. If you\u2019ve seen the trailer, you know the movie. He is a basketball coach. He gets fired for bad behaviour. He gets drunk. He is brought before a judge on a charge of rash driving, and the judge gives him community service. She asks him to train a team of what she calls \u201cintellectually disabled\u201d youngsters for the National Basketball Championships. I have not seen the Spanish original or the Hollywood remake, but taken as is, this is the story of an ego-filled man who doesn\u2019t even know how to apologise to his wife Suneeta (Genelia Deshmukh). He thinks this is going to be about him coaching a team with special needs. He slowly realises that this team will end up beinghiscoach in matters of the heart.\n\nYou can read the rest of the review here:\n\nCopyright \u00a92025 GALATTA."
